The purpose of the Home page is to function as the first point of contact for all visitors. It should seamlessly connect people with the most suitable content for their immediate needs; it provides information at a high level of abstraction and guides visitors towards more relevant and detailed content within the site. 

This page contains minimal content, so that visitors are able to quickly scan the page. It should not be cluttered or overwhelming. It should reflect Roc's goals (fast, friendly, functional) and values (welcoming community).
