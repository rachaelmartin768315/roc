<!--
In this section we want to explain the process, i.e. it's less formal

TODO finish editing this section
-->

Roc doesn't have a formal process for managing design proposals. The guiding principal for now is that as a community we should all be friendly, supportive, and openly discuss and sharing ideas.

There are three loose stages that a design proposal can go through in Roc: Idea, Proposal, and Implementation.

In the Idea stage, people are encouraged to describe their idea and explore the problem, potential solutions, and trade-offs. It is helpful to share the idea in the group chat using the #ideas channel.

If there is a general consensus that an idea is promising and worth developing, people are encouraged to develop a design Proposal. Some ideas are simple and should progress straight to implementation. However, for more complex Proposals a it write the design into an article or blog post and share it online. This documentation helps in clarifying the proposal and making it more accessible to the community. 

Implementation using PR...
