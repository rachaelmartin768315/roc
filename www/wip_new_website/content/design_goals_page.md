# Design Goals

<!-- 

This page outlines at a high level of abstraction the design goals for Roc, and provides an assessment/overview of current progress 

The three goals are Fast, Friendly, and Functional
- communicate the key selling points of Roc
- essence that sets the language apart

TODO move content from current home page, update for current progress
-->

# Fast

<!--
more universal appeal

don't take this for granted, drive this, it doesn't happen automatically

making lists of things -- maybe someday we can automatically optimise, we would like people to take the extra time to think about this

give people the tools to measure performance

benchmarking??
-->

# Friendly

<!--  
encouraging community values - e.g. designing a library
immersed in the friendliness

testing??
-->

# Functional

<!-- 
if your already a fan

for others, some people find it unfamiliar and maybe even negative (don't assume this is automatically a positive) - don't worry
-->
