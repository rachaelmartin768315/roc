## Goals
<section class="home-goals-container">
    <div class="home-goals-column">
      <h3 class="home-goals-title">Fast</h4>
      <p class="home-goals-description">Delightful software runs fast. The Roc compiler should run fast, and it should be able to produce programs that run fast too. <a class="home-goals-learn-more" href="/design_goals.html#fast">What does <i>fast</i> mean here?</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-goals-column">
      <h3 class="home-goals-title">Friendly</h3>
      <p class="home-goals-description">Roc aims to be a user-friendly language with a friendly community of users. This involves the set of tools Roc includes, and also the spirit of the community of Roc programmers. <a class="home-goals-learn-more" href="/design_goals.html#friendly">What does <i>friendly</i> mean here?</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-goals-column">
      <h3 class="home-goals-title">Functional</h3>
      <p class="home-goals-description">Roc is a purely functional programming language. The language is built on a small set of simple primitives, which together give you a toolset that's more than the sum of its parts. <a class="home-goals-learn-more" href="/design_goals.html#functional">What does <i>functional</i> mean here?</a></p>

## Examples

We have developed a number of smaller code [examples](https://github.com/roc-lang/examples) which demonstrate how to use Roc. These cover a range of topics from basic syntax to more advanced features such as random number generation and using the popular `Task` feature.

## Use cases

-   Tools & Scripts
-   Web (coming soon)
-   Networking & Servers (coming soon)
-   Graphical (coming soon)
-   Scientific (coming soon)
-   Embedded (coming soon)

## Platforms & Applications

TODO provide explanation of platform/application abstraction versus libraries as common in most other languages as this is one of the most unique features of Roc
