<p id="tagline">A fast, friendly, functional language.</p>

<!-- This exact sample was chosen for several reasons:

1. It's plausible to figure out what it's doing even if you don't know the language yet.
2. It uses a higher-order function, giving a functional first impression.
3. It shows some things not found in most mainstream languages, e.g. function calls without parens, lambda syntax.
4. It shows some things not found in most FP languages, e.g. string interpolation, passing a lambda without `<|` or `$`
5. It's horizontally small enough that it can be read on mobile without a scroll bar or shrinking the font size.

<p><b>Fast</b> - Roc code is designed to build fast and run fast. It compiles to machine code or to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>. Like <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, it compiles to unboxed data structures using monomorphization and LLVM for optimizations.</p>
<p><b>Friendly</b></p>
<p><b>Functional</b></p>

## Examples

We have developed a number of smaller code [examples](https://github.com/roc-lang/examples) which demonstrate how to use Roc. These cover a range of topics from basic syntax to more advanced features such as random number generation and using the popular `Task` feature.

## Use cases

-   Tools & Scripts
-   Web (coming soon)
-   Networking & Servers (coming soon)
-   Graphical (coming soon)
-   Scientific (coming soon)
-   Embedded (coming soon)

## Platforms & Applications

TODO provide explanation of platform/application abstraction versus libraries as common in most other languages as this is one of the most unique features of Roc
