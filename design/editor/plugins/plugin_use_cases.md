# Bundled with package (=library)

- Regex description to actual regex.
- Color picker.
- Visualising parser execution: [example](https://github.com/fasterthanlime/pegviz).

# Standalone

- Translating short pieces of code from another programming language to Roc. [Relevant research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTzFJIknh7E). Someone who only knows the R language could get started with Roc with less friction if they could quickly define a list R style (`lst <- c(1,2,3)`) and get it translated to Roc.
- Translate linux commands like curl to Roc code.
- Diff viewer
- Plugin to present codebase to new developer or walk co-worker through a problem. Records sequence of filenames and line numbers.
- Logbook; I've found that writing down steps and thoughts when you're implementing or debugging something can be really useful for later. If we make an integrated terminal, we can automatically add executed commands to this logbook. This plugin could have a publish button so you can produce useful "blogs" for others with minimal effort.
- Upload selected code/file to gist.
- Friendly/smart text filtering; be able to filter values by selecting a part. For example; logs contain `roc_expect_buffer_109680`, we select `109680`, numbers at identical positions are extracted.
- Diagram rendering from text, similar to [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
- Pomodoro timer to remind you to take breaks regularly.
