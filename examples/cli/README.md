# CLI

To run:

```bash
$ cargo run run Main.roc
```

To run with an optimized build of the Roc application (so the compiled app runs faster):

```bash
$ cargo run run --optimize Main.roc
```

To run with a release build of the `roc` compiler (so the compiler itself runs faster):

```bash
$ cargo run --release run Main.roc
```
