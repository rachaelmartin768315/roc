# ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE! ⚠️
#
# This file is a fixture template. If the file you're looking at is
# in the fixture-templates/ directory, then you're all set - go ahead
# and modify it, and it will modify all the fixture tests.
#
# If this file is in the fixtures/ directory, on the other hand, then
# it is gitignored and will be overwritten the next time tests run.
# So you probably don't want to modify it by hand! Instead, modify the
# file with the same name in the fixture-templates/ directory.
