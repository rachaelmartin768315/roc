# A Simple Markdown Example

This file contains `form.roc` embedded as a block in Markdown. It lets us test that `roc check` works with Markdown.

```roc
app [main] { pf: platform "https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.15.0/SlwdbJ-3GR7uBWQo6zlmYWNYOxnvo8r6YABXD-45UOw.tar.br" }

import pf.Stdin
import pf.Stdout

main =
    Stdout.line! "What's your first name?"
    firstName = Stdin.line!
    Stdout.line! "What's your last name?"
    lastName = Stdin.line!

    Stdout.line "Hi, $(firstName) $(lastName)! ðŸ‘‹"
```

Excitingly, we can have another block of Roc code as well! (In this case it is the same one...)

```roc
app [main] { pf: platform "https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.15.0/SlwdbJ-3GR7uBWQo6zlmYWNYOxnvo8r6YABXD-45UOw.tar.br" }

import pf.Stdin
import pf.Stdout

main =
    Stdout.line! "What's your first name?"
    firstName = Stdin.line!
    Stdout.line! "What's your last name?"
    lastName = Stdin.line!

    Stdout.line "Hi, $(firstName) $(lastName)! ðŸ‘‹"
```
