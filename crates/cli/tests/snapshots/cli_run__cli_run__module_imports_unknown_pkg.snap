── UNRECOGNIZED PACKAGE in tests/module_imports_pkg/ImportsUnknownPkg.roc ──────

This module is trying to import from `cli`:

3│  import cli.Foo
           ^^^^^^^

A lowercase name indicates a package shorthand, but I don't recognize
this one. Did you mean one of these?

    pkg

Note: I'm using the following module to resolve package shorthands:

    tests/module_imports_pkg/app.roc

You can specify a different one with the --main flag.
