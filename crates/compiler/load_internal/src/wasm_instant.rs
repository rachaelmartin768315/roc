#![cfg(target_family = "wasm")]
/*
For the Web REPL (repl_www), we build the compiler as a Wasm module.
Instant is the only thing in the compiler that would need a special implementation for this.
There is a WASI implementation for it, but we are targeting the browser, not WASI!
It's possible to write browser versions of WASI's low-level ABI but we'd rather avoid it.
Instead we use these dummy implementations, which should just disappear at compile time.
