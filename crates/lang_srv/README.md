[Semantic highlighting](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Semantic-Highlighting-Overview#what-is-the-difference-between-syntax-and-semantic-highlighting) will be added soon. Additional features require
changes to the compiler infrastructure that are not yet available.

Note that the language server is a bit na√Øve:
- If you make a change in a dependency, you'll also need to make a change in
    the dependents' files for the changes to be picked up.
- The language server will only operate on changes on save, auto-saving is recommended.

## Installing

The roc_lang_server binary is included with the [nightly releases](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/releases). We recommend using the same version of roc and roc_lang_server.

### Building from source

Follow the [building from source](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/BUILDING_FROM_SOURCE.md) instructions for roc. Then run:

```
# do `nix develop` first if you're using nix!
cargo build -p roc_lang_srv --release
```

This will give you the language server binary at:

```
target/release/roc_ls
```

### Configuring in your editor

Please follow your editor's language server implementation's documentation to see how custom language servers should be configured.

#### [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

Add the following to your coc JSON configuration file:

```
{
  "languageserver": {
    "roc": {
      "command": "<path to binary folder>/roc_ls",
      "filetypes": ["roc"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using coc.nvim and want to use the configuration above, be sure to also instruct your vim that `*.roc` files have roc filetype.

## Debug

If you want to debug the server, use [debug_server.sh](./debug_server.sh)
instead of the direct binary.

If you would like to enable debug logging set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `debug` or `trace` for even more logs. 
eg: `RUST_LOG=debug`
