/// This calls C's `alloca` function to allocate some bytes on the stack,
/// then provides those bytes to the given callback function.
///
/// It provides a `&mut c_void` to reflect the lifetime of that memory
/// (it only lives for the duration of the callback), which you'll probably
/// want to cast to something else. To cast `ptr` to the type you want,
/// use `&mut *(ptr as *mut _ as *mut _)` - for example:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// with_stack_bytes(size_of::<Foo>(), |ptr| {
///     let foo: &mut Foo = &mut *(ptr as *mut _ as *mut _);
/// ```
///
/// Yes, both `as *mut _` casts are necessary! The first one casts it to
/// a `*mut c_void` and the second one casts it to the pointer type you want.
/// Finally, the `&mut *` converts it from a pointer to a mutable reference.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is `#[inline(always)]`, which means it will allocate
/// the bytes on the stack of whoever calls this function.
///
/// Naturally, if you give this a large number of bytes, it may cause
/// stack overflows, so be careful!
///
/// Due to how Rust FFI works with inlining, in debug builds this actually
/// allocates on the heap (using `malloc`) and then deallocates the memory
/// (using `free`) before the callback returns. In debug builds, this can lead
/// to memory leaks if the callback panics - but release builds should be fine,
/// because they only ever allocate on the stack.
