# PROBLEMS
**MISSING HEADER**
Roc files must start with a module header.

For example:
        module [main]
or for an app:
        app [main!] { pf: platform "../basic-cli/platform.roc" }
Here is the problematic code:

**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **<unknown>** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.
