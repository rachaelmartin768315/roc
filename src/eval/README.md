# Eval

Runtime evaluation and interpretation system for executing Roc programs during compilation.

The eval module is the fourth stage of the Roc compiler pipeline, responsible for interpreting and executing Roc programs. It provides a fast development experience by allowing code to run immediately after type checking, without needing to go through the full compilation and linking process.
