# REPL Implementation Status

## Summary

We have successfully created a working REPL foundation with state management and partial interpreter integration. The core architecture is in place, but full interpreter integration requires additional work to handle variable references and past definitions properly.

## What's Working

### 1. **REPL State Management** (`repl_full.zig`)
- ✅ Tracks past definitions in order
- ✅ Correctly identifies and stores identifiers from assignments
- ✅ Handles special commands (`:help`, `:reset`, `:exit`)
- ✅ Properly manages memory with cleanup
- ✅ Builds full source from past definitions

### 2. **Basic Expression Evaluation**
- ✅ Successfully parses expressions using `parse.parseExpr()`
- ✅ Creates CIR (Canonical Intermediate Representation)
- ✅ Performs canonicalization
- ✅ Type checks expressions
- ✅ Evaluates simple literals (like "42") through the interpreter

### 3. **Test Infrastructure**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for REPL functionality
- ✅ Tests for state management and redefinitions
- ✅ Minimal interpreter integration test that passes

## Current Limitations

### 1. **Variable Reference Resolution**
The main challenge is evaluating expressions that reference variables defined in past REPL interactions. For example:
```roc
» x = 5
5
» y = x + 1
6
» x = 10
10
» y
6  # Should still be 6, not 11
```

### 2. **Context Preservation**
When evaluating an expression like `y` that references `x`, we need to:
- Parse all past definitions as a complete module
- Canonicalize the entire context
- Extract and evaluate just the requested expression
- Maintain proper scoping rules

## Implementation Challenges Encountered

### 1. **Segfault Issues**
Initial attempts to use the full interpreter resulted in segfaults. The minimal test showed this was due to incorrect setup, not a fundamental issue with the interpreter.

### 2. **API Mismatches**
Several function names and types changed between our assumptions and the actual implementation:
- `parse.parseFile()` → `parse.parse()`
- `getStmt()` → `getStatement()`
- `s_value_def` → `s_decl`
- `p_ident` → `assign`

### 3. **Identifier Resolution**
Getting identifier strings requires using `cir.env.idents.getText()` rather than parsing tokens directly.

## Next Steps

### 1. **Fix Variable Reference Evaluation**
The key is to properly set up the evaluation context:
```zig
// 1. Build complete source with all definitions
// 2. Parse as a file/module
// 3. Canonicalize everything
// 4. Type check all definitions
// 5. Evaluate just the requested expression
```

### 2. **Handle Different Input Types**
- **Assignments**: Extract and evaluate the RHS, store the definition
- **Expressions**: Evaluate in context of past definitions
- **Type annotations**: Store but don't evaluate
- **Import statements**: Handle module imports

### 3. **Improve Error Handling**
- Graceful recovery from parse errors
- Better error messages for undefined variables
- Handle partial/incomplete expressions

### 4. **Add Missing Features**
- String evaluation
- List/record evaluation
- Function definitions and calls
- Pattern matching
- Module imports

## Code Architecture

### Key Components:
1. **`Repl` struct**: Main REPL state container
2. **`PastDef` struct**: Stores individual definitions
3. **`evaluateSource()`**: Core evaluation logic
4. **`processInput()`**: Handles commands and parsing

### Memory Management:
- Each `PastDef` owns its source string
- Module environments own their source copies
- Proper cleanup in defer blocks

## Testing Strategy

### Current Tests:
1. **Initialization**: Basic REPL creation/cleanup
2. **Special Commands**: `:help`, `:reset`, `:exit`
3. **Simple Expressions**: Direct evaluation
4. **Redefinitions**: Variable shadowing
5. **Source Building**: Combining past definitions

### Needed Tests:
1. **Complex Expressions**: Arithmetic, function calls
2. **Error Recovery**: Invalid syntax, undefined variables
3. **Type Checking**: Type errors and inference
4. **Memory Stress**: Large number of definitions

## Conclusion

The REPL foundation is solid with working state management and basic interpreter integration. The main remaining work is properly handling variable references across multiple definitions. Once this is solved, adding additional features will be straightforward.

The architecture supports incremental development - we can add features one at a time while maintaining a working REPL throughout the process.
