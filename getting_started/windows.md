# Roc installation guide for Windows systems

Windows support is limited, [folkertdev](https://github.com/folkertdev) and [lukewilliamboswell](https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell) are working on improving this ðŸš€. Until that is done we recommend using [Ubuntu 22.04](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pn20msr04dw?hl=en-us&gl=US) through the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL).

Once you're inside Ubuntu, [install Roc](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/getting_started/linux_x86_64.md).
