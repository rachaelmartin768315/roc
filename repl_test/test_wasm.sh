# We *could* write a build.rs to do this but we'd have nested cargo processes with different targets.
# That can be solved using two separate target direcories with --target-dir but there isn't a huge win.
# We need to clear RUSTFLAGS for this command, as CI sets normally some flags that are specific to CPU targets.
